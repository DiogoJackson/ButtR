# ButtR

R package to download and install all or part of the Oz butterflies database.

The Oz butterflies database can be downloaded manually, however it is simpler to
use this package to do so. The database is quite large, so if the
entire database is not required, `buttR` provides an efficient mechanism to download
and install only the desired parts of the database.

If you use the Oz butterflies database, please cite the paper:
