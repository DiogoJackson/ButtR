# OzButterflies database

This folder contains the OzButterflies database. It consists of this README.txt file, 2 spreadsheets (summary and specimen, each in 3 formats), reflectance spectra of the red, green and blue colour standards (standard-\<colour\>.ProcSpec files) and specimen data files (photographs, spectra, and cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) sequence).

Specimen data file are stored in folders by family, species and specimen ID.

## Summary spreadsheet

The summary spreadsheet, Oz_butterflies_summary.csv, .xslx or .json, contains a row for each species in the database and the following columns:
