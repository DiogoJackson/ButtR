This data set is a forest inventory of Nothofagus antarctica in southern Chile. More than 20 sites were selected. In each site, parallel transects were set and every 30 m a sampling point was set where the distance to the nearest four trees (in accordance with the cardinal points) were measured.variable name and descriptionSTAND - or site, it is where the sampling was conducted; sites varied in terms of precipitation, from very-humid. humid, mesic, and dryTRANSECT - a line draw within the standPLOT - it is the sampling unit; it is located within the transect
